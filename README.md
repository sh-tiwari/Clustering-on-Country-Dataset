# Clustering-on-Country-Dataset
This is the Unsupervised learning project. Here I performed Kmean Clustering As well as Heirarchichal Clustering on Country Dataset To find out the under-developed countries that are in need of direct aid from CEO's of NGO's.
To run this Project you need to install some python modules that are as follows:
            Pandas
            Numpy
            Matplotlib
            Sklearn
            Seaborn
            Scipy
